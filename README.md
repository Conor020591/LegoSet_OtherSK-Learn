# LegoSet_RidgeRegression
The first model utilized in this project is the ridge regression. I used the RidgeCV() class to automaticall optimize the parameters. This also found that the optimal encoding for the categorical data was different to the linear regression. And a better RMSE was found when predicting the validation set.
